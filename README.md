# ðŸŽ® Game design document

This is an adaptation of the [Game design template by Rosa Carbo-Mascarell](https://glamorous-save-06a.notion.site/Game-design-template-0132383574dd4c2dbff5d14e3a90761c) for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). 

*Since the files are Markdown, they can be opened in most text editor. Obsidian is not needed, only intended.*

## Installation

Extract the files to an Obsidian vault directory from the downloaded zip file.

## Missing content

Some content from the website was not copied to this adaptation. That's mostly because I was lazy and didn't have time to do so, I might update it later.

### Here is what I know to be missing

- Images
- Tables (only present as link to the website, not actual tables)
- Some Descriptions and examples

All these are missing because I didn't need them for how I intended to use the documents, but it wouldn't hurt to add them either.

## What to fill/not fill

The content that is higlighted is meant to be replaced by what it's describing.

```
==This is higlighted==

this is not higlighted
```
